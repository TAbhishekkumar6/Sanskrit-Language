# Sanskrit Programming Language Improvements

## Overview

The Sanskrit programming language has been enhanced with several key features that make it more accessible, less error-prone, and more developer-friendly while preserving its cultural and philosophical foundations.

## Key Improvements

1. **Dual-Mode Syntax**: Support for both Devanagari and romanized Sanskrit, allowing developers to use the script they're most comfortable with.

2. **Simplified Operators**: Replaced capitalized English operators with standard mathematical symbols for cleaner code:
   - `YOGA` → `+` (addition)
   - `VIYOGA` → `-` (subtraction)
   - `GUNA` → `*` (multiplication)
   - `BHAGA` → `/` (division)

3. **Default Parameters**: Added support for default function parameters, eliminating the need for multiple function definitions.

4. **String Interpolation**: Implemented template literals with backticks for easier string formatting:
   ```sanskrit
   `नमस्ते ${नाम}!`
   ```

5. **Pattern Matching**: Introduced elegant pattern matching for cleaner alternatives to switch-case and complex if-else chains.

6. **Enhanced Error Messages**: Provided dual-language error messages in both Sanskrit and English for easier debugging.

7. **Shorter Identifiers**: Reduced the length of commonly used identifiers to prevent typing errors.

8. **Type Inference**: Improved type inference capabilities to reduce the need for explicit type annotations.

9. **Autocompletion Dictionary**: Added IDE integration for Sanskrit terms with translations and examples.

## Implementation Details

The implementation involved changes to:

- **Tokenizer**: Updated to support new syntax features, dual-mode keywords, and operators.
- **Parser**: Enhanced to handle default parameters, template literals, and pattern matching.
- **Compiler**: Added support for compiling new features to JavaScript.
- **Error Handling**: Improved to provide bilingual error messages.

## Benefits

- Reduced learning curve for developers new to Sanskrit programming
- More concise and expressive code
- Better integration with modern development environments
- Preserved cultural uniqueness while improving developer experience
