# Contributing to ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§ Programming Language

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§ (Sanskrit) programming language project. This document provides guidelines for contributing to the development of this unique programming language that bridges ancient wisdom with modern technology.

## Code of Conduct

In the spirit of Sanskrit philosophy, we ask all contributors to:
- Practice `‡§Ö‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ` (ahimsa) - non-violence in communications
- Maintain `‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø` (satya) - truthfulness in all contributions
- Follow `‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø` (svadhyaya) - self-study and continuous learning
- Respect `‡§∏‡§Ç‡§§‡•ã‡§∑` (santosha) - contentment and acceptance of feedback

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Terminology and Language Design

Help us refine the Sanskrit terminology used in the language:
- Suggest Sanskrit terms for programming concepts
- Improve transliteration and romanization
- Review Sanskrit grammatical usage in the codebase
- Propose enhancements to the language syntax based on Sanskrit grammar

### 2. Standard Library Development

Contribute to expanding the standard library:
- Implement new modules as outlined in the roadmap
- Write idiomatic Sanskrit code examples
- Develop test cases for existing modules
- Improve documentation with proper Sanskrit explanations

### 3. Compiler and Parser Development

For those with compiler experience:
- Work on the parser for Sanskrit syntactic structures
- Help implement the full Sanskrit keyword system
- Contribute to the type system based on Sanskrit categories
- Optimize the compiler for performance

### 4. Documentation and Learning Resources

Help make Sanskrit programming accessible:
- Write tutorials connecting Sanskrit concepts to programming
- Create learning materials for new users
- Translate documentation into regional Indian languages
- Develop interactive examples and visualizations

### 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

Ensure the language maintains high quality:
- Report bugs and issues
- Create comprehensive test suites
- Verify compatibility across platforms
- Review code for adherence to Sanskrit programming principles

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** - Create your own copy of the project
2. **Set up your development environment** - Follow instructions in `docs/development_setup.md`
3. **Pick an issue** - Look for issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted"
4. **Discuss your approach** - Before making significant changes, discuss in the relevant issue
5. **Follow coding standards** - Adhere to the guidelines in `docs/code_style.md`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** - Name it according to the feature or fix
2. **Write tests** - Ensure your changes are covered by tests
3. **Update documentation** - Include Sanskrit terminology explanations
4. **Submit your PR** - Include a clear description of changes
5. **Code review** - Address feedback from maintainers
6. **Merge** - Once approved, your PR will be merged

## Naming Conventions

When adding new Sanskrit terms:
- Include both Devanagari and romanized versions
- Provide English translations in comments
- Follow grammatical correctness in Sanskrit
- Maintain consistent transliteration style

## Documentation Standards

Documentation should include:
- Clear explanations in both English and Sanskrit where appropriate
- Examples showing both Devanagari and romanized syntax
- References to Sanskrit concepts where relevant
- Proper formatting for Sanskrit terminology

## Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues** - For bug reports and feature discussions
- **Community Forum** - For general questions and discussions
- **Monthly Meeting** - Virtual meetings for contributors (see schedule in `docs/meetings.md`)

## Recognition

All contributors will be recognized in our `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file. Significant contributions may earn traditional titles:
- `‡§Ü‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø` (acharya) - Masters who make substantial contributions
- `‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§®` (vidwan) - Scholars who contribute consistently
- `‡§∂‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø` (shishya) - Apprentices making their first contributions

Thank you for helping build a programming language that honors the rich tradition of Sanskrit while embracing modern technology.
